<h2>Get involved</h2>

<p>Although this isn't an open source project I would still very much love your participation through giving feedback. Ideas, criticism, whatever, I love it all equally because it tells me in what way I should steer Twitulater and make it what the <strong>users</strong> want it to be, not what I <em>think</em> you want.</p>
<p>You can give feedback through <a href="http://twitulater.uservoice.com">the uservoice page</a> or giving me a poke on <a href="http://twitter.com/swizec">@swizec (twitter)</a>, <a href="http://koornk.com/user/Swizec">@Swizec (koornk)</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/twitulaterApp">@twitulaterApp (twitter)</a>. And if all else fails, you can still reach me the old fashioned way via e-mail swizec[at]twitulater.com</p>
