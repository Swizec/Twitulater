<h1>History</h1>
<p>The first inklings of what was to become Twitulater started with my first attempts at using Koornk on 5th November 2008 and discovering a distinct lack of application that could understand both Twitter and Koornk. As the desire for developing a microblogging clientw as firmly planted I started looking at what was missing the most and a few days later I finally decided to make an applicatoin that would make my life easier.</p>
<p>Twitulater's development process started off by asking the community what platform they would want a twitter client to be on and we came to a mutual agreement on Adobe AIR because of its good portability. So on 11th November the first prototype was out.</p>
<p>On the first barcamp in slovenia, Barcamp Ljubljana 2009, Twitulater had its public unveiling outside the twitterverse and it garnered a lot of attention from the community who wanted it working on Koornk as soon as possible. Two weeks later, with version 0.9, koornk support was added.</p>
<p>You can study Twitulater's history more closely via the following changelog and even try out all antique versions except for 0.1, which was unfortunately lost.</p>
