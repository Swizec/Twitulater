<h2>Nightly version</h2>
<p>For the daring there is also a <a href="/downloader.php?file=Twitulater_nightly.air">nightly build</a> available that is automatically made every day at 04:30 CET (or CEST). Please assume that the nightly version is severely broken as I often commit uncompleted code to svn for backup reasons. But this is still the only way to get a glimpse of what the future holds before the future is here.</p>
